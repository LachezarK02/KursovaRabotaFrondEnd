		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<p class="text">
				In the anti-cellulite massage, we massage the areas with cellulite with energetic, warming movements and grips, and the goal is to break the fat cells and thus drain and remove the cellulite. When we properly treat the areas where cellulite most often appears, the body's natural recovery process starts. This enhances blood circulation and collagen production and helps to restore the tone, elasticity, softness and smoothness of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is very important to treat cellulite in time and correctly and combine it with training, fitness and nutritional diet to have a faster and better effect.

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<p class="text">
				Cupping - a method of treatment by vacuum. Vacuum cupping of the skin is an ancient Chinese method. Placing suction cups on the skin for a few minutes creates a blood stasis that helps blood circulation, thus cupping massage is at the forefront of pain relief procedures. It has the effect of drawing stagnant blood circulation from the tissues to the surface of the body and releasing compressed tendons near a joint by pulling a skin fold.
