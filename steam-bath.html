			<p class="text">One of the most famous ways to relax since ancient times is the steam bath. 
			A steam bath is categorized as a wet version of a Finnish sauna and is similar to a hammam. It usually emits heat around 45°C, with air humidity close to 100%. It is an excellent way of detoxification (cleansing the body of harmful substances). At the same time, it provides an anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving and hydrating effect.
			The most important health and beauty benefits of a steam bath are:<br>
			Improves blood supply - through the expansion of blood vessels, more blood reaches the whole body and the blood supply is significantly improved;<br> 
			It has a healing effect - for muscle fever, mild muscle pain; <br>
			The steam bath works perfectly with the simultaneous application of anti-cellulite therapies; <br>
			Detoxifies - thanks to the greater release of body fluids, the body is cleansed of dangerous toxins. Intense sweating relieves the kidneys perfectly;<br>
			Removes fat and dead cells – moisture refreshes and tones the body. Pores open and epidermal cells regenerate; 
			Cleanses the respiratory tract – the steam bath stimulates the excretory function of the bronchi. It also helps to increase the capacity of the lungs; <br>
			Relax – steam bath therapies have a relaxing effect and are extremely beneficial for the nervous system. </p>

			<p class="text">Valuable advices: <br>
			Use the toilet before procedures. However, the body will begin to remove toxins from your body and it is good that your stomach and intestines are empty; <br>
			Take a shower. Before you start, take time for a quick shower. In addition to removing dirt from your body, it will help you sweat more during the procedures; <br>
			Do not enter the steam bath after consuming food or alcohol;<br> 
			Before and after the steam bath, drink water, tea or juice;<br> 
			Reduce movements. During your stay in the room, do not make unnecessary movements. Just relax; <br>
			After leaving the steam bath, take a cool or cold shower. In this way, the already clean pores will close;<br>
			You can apply moisturizing creams after the procedures; <br>
			Don't overdo it. Spend about 10-15 minutes in the steam bath. We recommend doing 3 treatments at most, as well as taking cool showers to lower your body temperature. If you overdo it, you can cause significant problems;<br> 
			People with heart diseases are advised not to use the steam bath, as well as those with low or high blood pressure, children under 16 and pregnant women; <br>
			It is not recommended to use the steam bath if you are very tired; <br>
			The steam bath is not suitable for people who have dilated capillaries on the skin. <br>
			The power of the steam bath is considerable!
